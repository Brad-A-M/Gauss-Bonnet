\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that, given a surface, the sum of the curvature
at each point is equal to $2\pi$ times the Euler characteristic.
The theorem is a bridge between topological
and geometric information, see \figref{bridge}. 
This bridge can be traversed in both directions.
That is, if one has geometric information one obtains topological information and
if one has topological information one obtains geometric information.

In the book \emph{Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem}
\cite{jm08},
Matou\v{s}ek states that a theorem is a great theorem if there are
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item several different equivalent versions,
\item many different proofs,
\item a host of extensions and generalizations, and
\item numerous interesting applications.
\end{enumerate}

By this criteria, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is a great theorem.
For (1), six\todo{verify} different versions of the theorem are discussed
in \cite{wu_historical_2008}. 
We highlight a version for smooth surfaces in $\RR^3$ and
 a several discrete versions for triangulated surfaces. 
 Versions exist for surface with boundary even with cusps on
 the boundary.
 Local and global versions are given in \cite{doc76}.
Versions exist for higher dimensions \cite{guillemin_differential_2010}.
The versions we discuss are extrinsic, meaning they depend on an embedding
into $\R^n$, an intrinsic version, not depending on an embedding,
 is given in \cite{chern_simple_1944}.
 
 
As for (2), often, a proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem appears toward
the end of introductory textbooks on differential geometry relying on the ideas
developed in the text \cite{guillemin_differential_2010,pressley_elementary_2010}.
The most common proof is to first prove the theorem for simply connected domains
with boundary, then triangulate a surface and add up the contribution from each triangle.
The disadvantage of these proofs is that they do not provide geometric intuition \cite{wu_historical_2008},
but inorder to limit the number of definition included in the background,
we give proof using this strategy.
Several fundamentally different proofs exist.
For example, in \cite{guillemin_differential_2010}, 
the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf Theorem is used,
in \cite{doc76} Green's theorem is used.
A proof based on the calculus of
moving surfaces is given in \cite{grinfeld_introduction_2013}.\todo{other versions?}
For (3), two prominent generalizations include
the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem \cite{chern_simple_1944} and the Atiyahâ€“Singer index 
theorem \cite{atiyah_index_1963}.
This work is dedicated to (4).
Most, but not all, of our applications are related to geometric algorithms. 
We did not include any of the seven applications given in \cite{doc76}.
For applications to physics see \cite{tirado-physics-apps,gibbons_applications_2008}.
A historical survey of the theorem is given in \cite{wu_historical_2008}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
in \secref{background} we introduce definitions and notation that will be used
throughout the paper. We then state and prove the theorem.
In each subsection of \secref{applications}, we present an application of the theorem.
These subsections are independent.
I hope that the number of applications continues to grow,
please share any that you feel
ought to be included\footnote{\text{bradleymccoy@montana.edu}}.
