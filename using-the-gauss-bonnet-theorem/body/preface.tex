\subsection{A Great Theorem}
The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that, given a surface, the sum of the curvature
at each point is equal to $2\pi$ times the Euler characteristic.
The theorem is a bridge between many ideas that may
seem separate at first, see \figref{bridge}. 
Moreover, this bridge allows bidirectional traffic.

In the book \emph{Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem}
\cite{jm08},
Matou\v{s}ek states that a theorem is a great theorem if there are
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item several different equivalent versions,
\item many different proofs,
\item a host of extensions and generalizations, and
\item numerous interesting applications.
\end{enumerate}

By this criteria, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is a great theorem.
For (1), six\todo{verify} different versions of the theorem are discussed
in \cite{wu_historical_2008}. 
We highlight a version for smooth surfaces in $\RR^3$ and
 several discrete versions for triangulated surfaces. 
 Versions exist for surface with boundary even with cusps on
 the boundary.
 Local and global versions are given in \cite{doc76}.
Variations exist for higher dimensions \cite{guillemin_differential_2010}.
The versions we discuss are extrinsic, meaning they depend on an embedding
into $\R^n$, an intrinsic version, not depending on an embedding,
 is given in \cite{chern_simple_1944}.
 
 
As for (2), the most common proof is to first prove the theorem for simply connected domains
with boundary, then triangulate a surface and add up the contribution from each triangle.
The disadvantage of these proofs is that they do not provide geometric intuition \cite{wu_historical_2008}.
In order to limit the number of definition included in the background,
we give proof using this strategy.
Several fundamentally different proofs exist.
For example, in \cite{guillemin_differential_2010}, 
the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf Theorem is used,
in \cite{doc76,pressley_elementary_2010} Green's theorem is used,
in \cite{levi-bicycle} a theorem based on dual cones is given
and in \cite{grinfeld_introduction_2013}
a proof based on the calculus of
moving surfaces is given.\todo{other versions?}
For (3), two prominent generalizations include
the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem \cite{chern_simple_1944} and the Atiyahâ€“Singer index 
theorem \cite{atiyah_index_1963}.
This work is dedicated to (4).
Most, but not all, of our applications are related to geometric algorithms. 
We only include one of the seven applications given in \cite{doc76}.
For applications to physics see \cite{tirado-physics-apps,gibbons_applications_2008}.
A historical survey of the theorem is given in \cite{wu_historical_2008}.


\input{body/warm-up}

The remainder of this document is organized as follows:
in \secref{background} we introduce definitions and notation. 
We then state two versions of the theorem and prove one of them.
In each subsection of \secref{applications}, we present an application of the theorem.
These subsections are independent.
I hope that the number of applications continues to grow,
please share any that you feel
ought to be included\footnote{\text{bradleymccoy@montana.edu}}.
