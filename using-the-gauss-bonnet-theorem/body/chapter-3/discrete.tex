\section{A Discrete Version}
\label{sec:discrete}

In this section, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to derive
a definition of discrete curvature. We discuss how discrete curvature
is used to improve meshes that are generated by scanning.
We then state and prove a discrete version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
