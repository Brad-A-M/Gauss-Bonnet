In this section, we define the terms needed to state Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
We then present a proof of the theorem for a discrete surfaces.

\subsection{The Discrete Gauss-Bonnet}

Discrete curvature is an oxymoron. In a triangulated surface,
the curvature is zero or we are on a vertex where tangent vectors are not defined.
One application of the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem will be to confirm that the definition of discrete curvature 
given below is reasonable.
We would like our definition of discrete curvature to agree with
our intuition, that is if two segments co-linear, the curvature should be zero
and the curvature should signed.
