In this section, we define the terms needed to state Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
We then present a proof of the theorem for a discrete surfaces.

\subsection{The Discrete Gauss-Bonnet}

Discrete curvature is an oxymoron. In a triangulated surface,
the curvature is zero or we are on a vertex where tangent vectors are not defined.
One application of the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem will be to confirm that the definition of discrete curvature 
given below is reasonable.
We would like our definition of discrete curvature to agree with
our intuition, that is if two segments co-linear, the curvature should be zero
and the curvature should signed.

Consider a triangulated regular surface $S$ with boundary $\partial(S)$.
The boundary is a one dimensional piecewise linear curve in $\R^3.$
As with simple polygons in the plane, at each vertex $v\in \partial(S)$ 
we have an exterior angle and a complementary interior angle.
The exterior angle has the desired properties of a curvature definition mentioned above.
The interior angle might consist of many triangles.
Let $F_v$  denote the set of faces incident to $v$ and let
$\alpha_f$ denote the angle in face $f$ at $v$.
The \EMPH{discrete geodesic curvature}
of $v$  is
$$k_{g}(v)= \pi-\sum_{f\in F_v}\alpha_f.$$
Notice that if $v$ lies on a straight line, then $\sum_{i}\alpha_f=\pi$
and the curvature is zero as we would expect.
The word geodesic is used because we are measuring how close
a curve is to being straight with respect to the surface we are on.


A geometric definition of discrete Gaussian curvature is the following:
\begin{definition}[Discrete Gaussian curvature]\label{def:discrete-curvature-vertex}

The discrete \EMPH{Gaussian curvature} at a vertex $v$ is the area on the unit 
sphere bounded by a spherical polygon whose vertices are the unit normals of 
the faces around $v$.

\end{definition}

If a vertex is on a flat surface, then the unit normals are all pointed
in the same direction and the Gaussian curvature is zero.

\caption{Consider the vertex $v$ in the figure on the left. The curvature of $v$
is the area on the sphere shown on the right. We rotated the sphere
in order to see the entire polygon.}
\label{fig:discrete-curvature}
\end{figure}


Let $\alpha_i$ denote the angle of a triangle incident to $v$, 
we next show that the interior angle of the polygon $\beta_i$ on the 
sphere is supplementary $\alpha_i$.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:switcheroo}
\beta=\pi-\alpha.
\end{equation}
Notice that the edge between two faces
on a triangulated surface
is perpendicular to the normal vectors of the faces.
So, the line connecting two normal vectors will intersect the edge between the vectors 
at right angles. See \figref{switcheroo}.


\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{background/switch-angles}
\caption{The relationship between the angles incident to a vertex and
the interior angles of the area polygon on the sphere.}
\label{fig:switcheroo}
\end{figure}



This gives a  formula for computing the curvature at an interior vertex.
The \EMPH{angle defect} at a vertex $d(v)$ is the difference between $2\pi$ and
the sum of the incident angles.  Let $F_v$ denote the faces containing $v$  
and let $\alpha_f$  denote the interior  angle of face $f$ at $v$, then
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:defect}
d(v):=2\pi -\sum_{f\in F_v}\alpha_f.
\end{equation}
Since $\beta_i=\pi-\alpha_i$,
we can use our formula for the area of a polygon on the sphere,
\eqnref{sphere-area}, to compute the Gaussian curvature at $v$
by
$$K(v)=2\pi -n\pi+\sum_{i}^n \beta_i=2\pi-n\pi +\sum_{i}^n (\pi-\alpha_i) =2\pi-\sum_i^n\alpha_i=d(v)$$
 and the
 angle defect is equal to the discrete curvature in \defref{discrete-curvature-vertex}
 and in \eqnref{discrete-gaussian}.







Combining the above definitions  we have

\begin{theorem}[The Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Theorem] \label{thm:g-b-d}

If $S$ is a triangulated surface with  boundary $\partial S$ then

$$\sum_{v\in V_{int}} K(v) + \sum_{v\in V_{\partial S}} k_g(v) = 2\pi \chi(S)$$
where $K(v)$ is the discrete Gaussian curvature
of a vertex, $k_g(g)$ is the discrete geodesic curvature,  and
$\chi$ is the Euler characteristic.
\end{theorem}
