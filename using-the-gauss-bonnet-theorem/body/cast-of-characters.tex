\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
\label{sec:cast}

In this section, we define the terms needed to state Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
We then present a proof of the theorem for a discrete surfaces.


\subsection{Continuous Curvature}
\input{body/continuous-curvature}

%%%%%Euler Characteristic%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Triangulations and The Euler Characteristic}

We assume the reader is familiar with the notions
of topological spaces and simplicial complexes.
Most introductory topology texts describe these objects \cite{jm08,munkres}.
The applications we will encounter will refer to triangulated surfaces in $\R^3$
called a \EMPH{mesh}, in one application the surface will contain its interior.
Each triangle in a mesh is isomorphic to a triangle in the plane and the sum
of the interior angles is $\pi$.


We denote the set of vertices, edges and faces in a triangulated surface as 
$V, E$ and $F$ respectively.
Let $\partial(V)$ denote vertices on the boundary of a surface and let $V_{int}$ 
denote vertices that are not on the boundary.
See \figref{triangulated-torus} for an example of a triangulated surface.



The \EMPH{Euler Characteristic} of a surface $\chi$ is the 
the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus  the number of faces, $\chi=|V|-|E|+|F|.$
In higher dimensions, for a triangulated space $X$ the Euler characteristic is 
$\chi(X)=k_0-k_1+k_2-k_3+\ldots$ where $k_n$ is the number of simplices of dimension $n.$
The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant of a space
and does not depend on the choice of triangulation.


Two dimensional spheres $\Sp^2$ and two dimensional disk $D^2$ 
will be used in our applications.
For the sphere, we have $\chi(\Sp^2)=2$ 
several proofs of this can be found on David Eppstein's website \cite{eppstein-proofs}.
For the disk, $\chi(D^2)=1$. The disk can be triangulated by
a single solid triangle with three vertices, three edges and one face.



The \EMPH{genus} of a surface is the maximum number of closed simple
non-intersecting curves that can be drawn in the surface without separating
the surface.
The torus in \figref{triangulated-torus} has genus one.
By the classification of surfaces \cite{munkres}, the Euler characteristic or an orientable surface
is determined by its genus with $\chi=2-2g$.

%%%%%Euler Characteristic%%%%%%%%


Using these definitions we can state a continuous version of
the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for regular surfaces
\begin{theorem}[The Continuous Gauss-Bonnet Theorem] \label{thm:g-b-c}

$$\int_{M} K dA+ \int_{\partial M} k_g ds = 2\pi \chi(M)$$
where $M$ is a regular surface, $K$ is the continuous Gaussian curvature,
 $k_g$ is the continuous geodesic curvature and
$\chi$ is the Euler characteristic.
\end{theorem}


The  Gauss-Bonnet theorem is  telling us, if we add up curvature
at each vertex the sum will be $2\pi$ times to Euler characteristic.
If we can compute the curvature at every vertex then we can use the theorem
to learn global topological information.
Conversely, if we know the Euler characteristic we can learn about the curvature
at individual points.

\subsection{A Discrete Version}

Discrete curvature is an oxymoron. In a triangulated surface,
the curvature is zero or we are on a vertex where tangent vectors are not defined.
Our first application of the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem will be to confirm that the definition of discrete curvature 
given below is reasonable.
We would like our definition of discrete curvature to agree with
our intuition, that is if two segments co-linear, the curvature should be zero
and the curvature should signed.
The one dimensional piecewise linear curves we encounter will be the boundaries
of triangulated two dimensional surfaces in $\R^3.$
At each vertex on the boundary we have an exterior angle and a complementary interior angle.
The exterior angle has the desired properties of a curvature definition mentioned above.
The interior angle might consist of many triangles.
For a vertex $v$ on the boundary of a surface, 
let $F_v$  denote the set of incident faces and let
$\alpha_f$ denote the angle in face $f$ at $v$.
The \EMPH{discrete geodesic curvature}
of $v$  is
$$k_{g}(v)= \pi-\sum_{f\in F_v}\alpha_f.$$
Notice that if $v$ lies on a straight line, then $\sum_{i}\alpha_f=\pi$
and the curvature is zero as we would expect.
The word geodesic refers to measuring how close
a curve is to being straight with respect to the surface we are on.


A geometric definition of Gaussian curvature is the following:

\begin{definition}[Discrete Gaussian curvature]\label{def:discrete-curvature-vertex}

The discrete \EMPH{Gaussian curvature} at a vertex $v$ is the area on the unit 
sphere bounded by a spherical polygon whose vertices are the unit normals of 
the faces around $v$.

\end{definition}

If a vertex is on a flat surface, then the unit normals are all pointed
in the same direction and the Gaussian curvature is zero.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{curvature/discrete-curvature}
\caption{Consider the vertex $v$ on the left. The curvature of $v$
is the area on the sphere shown on the right. We rotated the sphere
in order to see the entire polygon.}
\label{fig:discrete-curvature}
\end{figure}


We can verify that \defref{discrete-curvature-vertex} agrees with the formula we derived using
the Gauss-Bonnet.
The interior angles of the polygon $\beta_i$ on the sphere are supplementary to
the angle $\alpha_i$ incident to $v$ in the surface

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:switcheroo}
\beta=\pi-\alpha.
\end{equation}
To see this, notice that the edge between two faces
on a triangulated surface
is perpendicular to the normal vectors of the faces.
So, the line connecting two normal vectors will intersect the edge between the vectors 
at right angles. See \figref{switcheroo}.


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{background/switch-angles}
\caption{The relationship between the angles incident to a vertex and
the interior angles of the area polygon on the sphere.}
\label{fig:switcheroo}
\end{figure}



This gives a  formula for computing the curvature at an interior vertex.
The \EMPH{angle defect} at a vertex $d(v)$ is the difference between $2\pi$ and
the sum of the incident angles.  Let $F_v$ denote the faces containing $v$  
and let $\alpha_f$  denote the interior  angle of face $f$ at $v$, then
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:defect}
d(v):=2\pi -\sum_{f\in F_v}\alpha_f.
\end{equation}
Since $\beta_i=\pi-\alpha_i$,
we can use our formula for the area of a polygon on the sphere,
\eqnref{sphere-area}, to compute the Gaussian curvature at $v$
by
$$K(v)=2\pi -n\pi+\sum_{i}^n \beta_i=2\pi-n\pi +\sum_{i}^n (\pi-\alpha_i) =2\pi-\sum_i^n\alpha_i=d(v)$$
 and the
 angle defect is equal to the discrete curvature in \defref{discrete-curvature-vertex}
 and in \eqnref{discrete-gaussian}.







Putting all of these variables together gives

\begin{theorem}[The Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Theorem] \label{thm:g-b-d}

$$\sum_{v\in V_{int}} K(v) + \sum_{v\in V_{\partial S}} k_g(v) = 2\pi \chi(S)$$
where $S$ is a triangulation, $K(v)$ is the discrete Gaussian curvature
of a vertex, $k_g(g)$ is the discrete geodesic curvature and
$\chi$ is the Euler characteristic.
\end{theorem}
