\label{sec:cast}


The Gauss-Bonnet theorem is a bridge. On one shore is topology and
on the other shore geometry. This bridge can be traveled in both directions.
That is, if one has geometric information one can deduce topological information and
if one has topological information one can deduce geometric information.
In symbols, the theorem can be stated as follows

$$\int_M K dA + \int_{\partial M} k_g ds = 2\pi \chi(M).$$

In this section, we define these symbols.
