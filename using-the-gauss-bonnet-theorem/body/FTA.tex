\subsection{The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
\label{sec:fta}

In this section, we share a proof due to Almira and Romero that
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem implies the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra \cite{almira_yet_2007}.

The theorem is the following:
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]\label{thm:fta}
	Let $f:\CC \to \CC$ be a non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients,
	then $f$ has a least one complex root.
\end{theorem}

We now include ideas and definitions from complex analysis that are used
in the proof. A complex number can be separated into its real and imaginary parts $z=x+iy$
A continuous function $f:\CC\to \CC$ is a map $f(z)=f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ where $u$ and $v$ are continuous.
A function $f$ is \EMPH{analytic} at a point $z_0$ if there exists a neighborhood around $z_0$ 
such that $f$ is differentiable at each point in the neighborhood.
The \EMPH{Laplacian} of a function is the sum of the second order partial derivatives, denoted $\Delta f$
or just $\Delta$ if the function is clear,
in our case, $\Delta f=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}$.
If $\Delta f=0$ then the function $f$ is said to be \EMPH{harmonic}.

We prove a lemma
\begin{lemma}[Analytic Implies Real Part is Harmonic]\label{lem:anal-harmonic}
	The real part of an analytic function is harmonic.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Analytic complex functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations meaning
	$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \textrm{ and } \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=- \frac{\partial v}		{\partial x}.$$
	Differentiating again and using the fact that the mixed partial derivatives are equal
	we have
	$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)
	=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)=-\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.$$

	And $\Delta \textbf{Re}f=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=0$.
\end{proof}



Let $f:S_1\to S$ be a differentiable map from a surface to itself.
Such maps do not preserve geometric measurements (curvature or area), but the change
can be accounted for. We compute geometric quantities using the tangent plane and
a vector normal to the surface.
Let $S$ be a regular manifold with tangent space at a point $p$ $T_pS.$
The local parameterization on charts $(u,v):U\to \R^2$ form a basis for
$T_pS$.

Let $g$ be a smooth map on the charts $(U, (u,v))$ of a regular surface
$g(\frac{\partial}{\partial u},\frac{\partial}{\partial v}):U\to \R.$
A \EMPH{Riemannian metric} assigns to each $p$ a positive-definite inner product
$g_p:T_pS\times T_pS \to \R$ and we get a norm on $T_pS$ given by
$|v|_p=\sqrt{g_p(v,v)}$.
Since we have a Riemannian metric we get a map between the two inner products,
$Df_p:T_pS\to T_{f(p)}S$. Moreover, the inner product in the preimage is equal
to $|\det(Df_p)|$ times the inner product in the image.


We express the curvature using the Laplacian.
\begin{lemma}[Curvature and the Laplacian (13.1.3 \cite{dubrovin_modern_1984})]\label{lem:lapa-curve}
	If $u,v$ are conformal\todo{define} coordinates on a surface
	embedded in $\R^3$ with metric $d\ell^2=g(u,v)(du^2+dv^2),$
	then the Gaussian curvature is given by
	$$K=-\frac{1}{2g(u,v)}\Delta \ln g(u,v).$$
\end{lemma}



And now the proof of \thmref{fta}.

\begin{proof}
 Let $p(z)=a_0+a_1z+\ldots + a_nz^n$ and, for the sake of contradiction,
 assume that $p(z)\neq 0$ for all $z\in \CC$ and $a_0a_n\neq 0.$
 We can define two new functions using $p(z)$.
 Set $p_*(z)=a_n+a_{n-1}z+\ldots + a_0z^n$ and note that $p_*(z)=z^np(1/z)$ for $z\in \CC\setminus\{0\}$.
 Then let $f(z)=p(z)p_*(z)$ for all $z\in \CC.$
 Then $f$ has the property that
 $$\bigg | f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \bigg |=\frac{1}{|z|^{2n}}|f(z)|,$$ for $z\in \CC\setminus\{0\}.$
 The above property gives a well-defined Riemannian metric $g$ on $\widehat{\CC}$
 where 
 $$g=\frac{1}{|f(z)|^{\frac{2}{n}}}|dz|^2, \textrm{ for } z\in \CC \textrm{ and}$$
 $$g=\frac{1}{|f(1/z)|^{\frac{2}{n}}}|d(1/z)|^2 \textrm{ for } z\in \widehat{\CC}\setminus\{0\}.$$
 
 Now, we have the Gaussian curvature $K$ of $g$ implies that for all $z\in \widehat{\CC}$
 $$\frac{1}{|f(z)|^{\frac{2}{n}}} K =\frac{1}{n}\Delta(\log |f(z)|)=\frac{1}{n}\Delta \textbf{Re} \log(f(z))=0,$$
 for all $z\in \CC.$ 
 
Thus, the Gaussian curvature at every point is zero. However, the Gauss-Bonnet
 theorem states that the sum of the curvature over all $z\in \CC$ is $4\pi$, meaning there is at least
 one point where the curvature must be positive. This is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
