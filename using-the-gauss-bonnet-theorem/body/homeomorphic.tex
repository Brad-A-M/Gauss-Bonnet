\section{Classifying Surfaces}
\label{sec:classiify}


Given two surfaces one often wants to know
if there exists a homeomorphism between them.
\todo{find specific application? Maybe texture mappings}
By the classification of surfaces the topology of
an oriented surface is determined by is Euler characteristic.
Thus, we can determine if a homeomorphism exists simply by
counting the vertices, edges and faces of each surface.

Surfaces are often stored in a half-edge data structure \cite{Marks,Crane:2013}.
