\section{A Discrete Version}
\label{sec:discrete}

In this section, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to derive
a definition of discrete curvature. We discuss how discrete curvature
is used to improve meshes that are generated by scanning.
We then prove a discrete version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Consider a triangulated polygonal surface $S$ with boundary $\partial(S)$.
The boundary is a one dimensional piecewise linear curve in $\R^3.$
As with polygons in the plane, at each vertex $v\in \partial(S)$ 
we have an exterior angle.

The interior angle might consist of many triangles.
Let $F_v$  denote the set of faces incident to $v$ and let
$\alpha_f$ denote the angle in face $f$ at $v$.
The \EMPH{discrete geodesic curvature}
of $v$  is
$$k_{g}(v)= \pi-\sum_{f\in F_v}\epsilon_f.$$
See \figref{discrete-geodesic} for an illustration.
Notice that if $v$ lies on a straight line, then $\sum_{i}\epsilon_f=\pi$
and the curvature is zero as we would expect.

How should be define discrete Gaussian curvature?
At every non-vertex point on a polygonal surface, the continuous Gaussian curvature
is zero and at every vertex it is undefined.
We can use the intuitive definition of discrete geodesic curvature and the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem to give a definition for discrete Gaussian curvature.

Consider removing the neighborhood around a vertex $v$ consisting
of the faces incident to $v$ and the edges and vertices of these faces call
this $N(v)$.
Using the variable names given in \figref{discrete-geodesic},
the total geodesic curvature

\begin{align}
\int_{\partial N(v)} kg ds &=\sum_i \pi -(\tau_i+\sigma_{i+1})\nonumber  \\
       &=\sum_i \pi -(\tau_i+\sigma_{I}) \nonumber  \\
       &=\sum_i \alpha_i. \nonumber 
\end{align}
Where the second equality comes from the boundary being a circle and reorganizing the sum.
Topologically, this neighborhood is a disk and $\chi(N(v))=1$
so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells us that 
the discrete Gaussian curvature at a vertex is
\begin{definition}[Discrete Gaussian curvature\footnote{Discrete Gaussian curvature
is also called the \emph{angle defect} at a vertex}]\label{def:discrete-curvature-vertex}

$$K(v)=\int_{N(v)}K da=2\pi-\sum_i \alpha_i.$$

\end{definition}

Recall, that when we considered the curvature at a vertex on a polygon in the plane
in the theorem of turning tangents, \thmref{simple-bonnet}, we have two parts depending on
weather we use the interior or the exterior angles at each vertex.
We can do a similar thing with the discrete Gaussian curvature at a vertex on a surface,
instead of considering the angles of the faces incident to a vertex $v$, we can consider
the complementary angle. The complementary angle is shown in \figref{switcheroo}. 
If we let $n$ be the number of faces
incident to $v$, the formula for the discrete curvature then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:discrete-curvature-complement-angle}
K(v)=2\pi - \sum_{i=1}^n (\pi - \xi_i)=(2-n)\pi +\sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i.
\end{equation}
By \eqnref{sphere-area}, this is the area of the polygon on the sphere with interior
angles $\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots \xi_n.$
Geometrically, this angle be seen in \figref{switcheroo}.
If we project the normal vectors on each face onto a sphere and
connect these points with great arcs to create a polygon on the sphere with interior angles
$\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots \xi_n.$
We have a geometric representation of discrete
Gaussian curvature as the area on the unit 
sphere bounded by a spherical polygon whose vertices are the unit normals of 
the faces around $v$. An example is shown in \figref{discrete-curvature}.

is the area on the sphere shown on the right. We rotated the sphere
in order to see the entire polygon.}
\label{fig:discrete-curvature}
\end{figure}







Combining the above definitions  we have

\begin{theorem}[The Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Theorem] \label{thm:g-b-d}

If $S$ is a triangulated surface with  boundary $\partial S$ then
$$\sum_{v\in V_{int}} K(v) + \sum_{v\in V_{\partial S}} k_g(v) = 2\pi \chi(S)$$
where $K(v)$ is the discrete Gaussian curvature
of a vertex, $k_g(g)$ is the discrete geodesic curvature,  and
$\chi$ is the Euler characteristic.
\end{theorem}
