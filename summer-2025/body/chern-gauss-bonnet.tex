\section{Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem}
\label{sec:chern-gauss-bonnet}

In this section, we consider higher dimensional extensions of the
Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. 

Let's recall our definition of curvature at a point $p$ on a surface via the Gauss map.
We considered a `small' neighborhood around $p$ and computed
the area of the map of this neighborhood on the sphere. 

Let $S$ be an even-dimensional compact orientable hypersurface in 
$\R^{2n+1},$ and let

$$G:S\rightarrow \Sp^{2n}$$
be the Gauss map into the unit $2n$-sphere.
The pull-back $G^*\omega_{2n}$ is a $2n$ form on $S$ because
 the volume form \todo{define/discuss forms} of $\Sp^{2n}$ is $\omega_{2n}.$
 We are able to compute areas on $S$ using the same method as we did 
for $n=1.$

For even-dimensional hypersurfaces, our task is to show that 
$$\int_SG^*\omega_{2n}=2\pi \chi(S).$$
