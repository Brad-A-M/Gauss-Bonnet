\section{Polygonal Meshes}
\label{sec:polygonal}

In this section, we introduce polygonal meshes, describe a data structure to efficiently
work with them, and define the Euler characteristic.

\subsection{What is a surface?}

 Many surfaces are made up of many vertices, edges, and
triangles (or other polygons). We denote the set of vertices, edges and faces in a triangulated surface as 
$V, E$ and $F$ respectively. We call such a surface a \emph{mesh}
or triangulated mesh, if all faces are triangles.
An example of a triangular mesh is shown in \figref{cat},
notice that this mesh has a boundary on the collar, eyes, and mouth.
Let $\partial(V)$ denote vertices on the boundary of a surface and let $V_{int}$ 
denote vertices that are not on the boundary.

One way to store a mesh in a computer is as a OFF file.
The first optional line of an OFF file identifies the file as an OFF file.
The second line lists the number of vertices, faces, and edges.
A list of vertices in $(x,y,z)$ coordinates is then given followed
by a list of faces indicated by the index of the vertices contained in the face.
For the mesh in \figref{cat}, the OFF file looks is shown in 
\tabref{off}.

Suppose we work in a machine shop and a customer has an metal object that they would like
to duplicate.
One way to do this, is by 3D scanning the object to capture the coordinates on the 
surface and represent the object as a triangulated mesh, then use a machine to carve the object
from a block of metal. 
While scanning, errors might occur. As a result of these errors
we might obtain a triangulation that intersects itself. If we try to reconstruct the object
from our mesh our machines will have ambiguous information of what the surface of the object
should be.
This motivates developing an algorithm to determine if a mesh has self-intersections.
Determining if two faces intersect using the OFF representation of a surface is combersome.
To simplify algorithms on meshes we load the OFF file into a more convenient data-structure,
the doubly-connected edge list.

The doubly-connected edge list (DCEL) consists of three separate and related structures, one each
for the vertices, edges, and faces \cite{dutchbook3}.
For each edge, we store two directed half-edges $(\overrightarrow{e})$, with pointers to: its origin, the twin half-edge, the incident face that it bounds, the next half-edge bounding the same face, and the previous half-edge bounding the same face.



\subsection{The Euler Characteristic}

The \EMPH{Euler Characteristic} of a surface $\chi$ is the 
the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus  the number of faces, $\chi=|V|-|E|+|F|.$
In higher dimensions, for a triangulated space $X$ the Euler characteristic is 
$\chi(X)=k_0-k_1+k_2-k_3+\ldots$ where $k_n$ is the number of `triangles' of dimension $n.$
The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant of a space
and does not depend on the choice of triangulation.

A  graph  is \EMPH{planar} if it can be drawn in the plane with intersections only occurring
at vertices.
Two dimensional spheres $\Sp^2$ and two dimensional disk $D^2$ 
will be used in our applications.
For the sphere, we have $\chi(\Sp^2)=2$ 
several proofs of this can be found on David Eppstein's website \cite{eppstein-proofs}.




We include the following proof Thurston \cite{thurston}. 
For any planar graph we can map the graph on to the two sphere using stereographic projection.
 

\begin{theorem}[Euler Characteristic for Planar Graphs]\label{thm:euler}
For any planar graph on the 2-sphere we have $V-E+F=2.$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If needed, perturb the triangulation so that the north and south poles are 
inside of a two faces and there are no vertical edges. At each vertex place a unit positive
charge, at the center of each edge place a unit negative charge and put a unit positive
charge in the middle of each face. Slam the sphere on the ground so that all charges
on the edges and vertices are moved into the face below them. For faces that do not contain a pole
the net charge will be zero, the northern boundary consists of an alternating sequence
of edges and vertices  beginning  and ending with an edge.
The face containing the north pole has a unit positive charge, and the face containing the south
pole contains positive four units of charge and negative three units of charge.
Thus, the total charge is two.

\end{proof}

Triangulations of the sphere are a special case of \thmref{euler}.
The sphere will be one of two common surfaces we see in applications
of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The other being the disk.
For the disk, $\chi(D^2)=1$. This can be seen by considering
the removal of a single face from a triangulation of the sphere.
Once a face is removed, we can project the remaining faces of the sphere
onto the plane to obtain a triangulation of a disk. Moreover, this projection
is invertible and given a triangulation of a disk we can obtain a triangulation
of the sphere with a single face omitted.

The Euler characteristic of a connected, orientable surface surface is often 
stated in terms of the genus of the surface which is defined as follows.
\begin{definition}[Genus of a Surface]\label{def:genus}
	The genus of a connected, orientable surface is the maximum number of
	cuttings along non-intersecting simple closed curves without disconnecting
	the surface \cite{munkres}.
\end{definition}


For an orientable surface, the genus and the Euler characteristic are related by
the formula $\chi=2-2g$. To see this, we can transform a triangulation of a surface of
genus $g$ into a surface of genus $g+1$ by removing two faces and an equal number
of vertices and edges. \figref{genus} provides an example.
Thus, the sphere has genus zero and the torus has genus one.
